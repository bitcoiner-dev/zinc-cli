## 2024-03-24 - Insecure Default File Permissions
**Vulnerability:** The CLI application creates sensitive configuration files and directories (like wallets and snapshot data) using standard `fs::create_dir_all` and `fs::write` in Rust. These standard functions create files/directories using the system's default umask, which typically allows other users on the same Unix-like system to read the sensitive files.
**Learning:** This could lead to a local privilege escalation or exposure of sensitive user data if the user runs the CLI on a shared machine. Relying on default system configurations for sensitive files is unsafe.
**Prevention:** Always use `std::os::unix::fs::DirBuilderExt` and `std::os::unix::fs::OpenOptionsExt` to explicitly set file permissions (e.g., `0o700` for directories and `0o600` for files) when creating sensitive data on disk.

## 2024-03-24 - Secure File Writing Regression Prevention
**Vulnerability:** The `maybe_write_text` utility function was using `std::fs::write`, which resulted in sensitive data (like PSBT files and offers) being saved with insecure default file permissions, making them readable by other users on a shared system.
**Learning:** Even generic utility functions used for saving user-requested command outputs must use secure file permissions (`0o600`) if the data they handle (like PSBTs and offers) is sensitive.
**Prevention:** Always use `crate::paths::write_secure_file` instead of `std::fs::write` for all file writing operations that might contain sensitive material in this codebase.
## 2024-05-24 - [CRITICAL] Fix Path Traversal in Profile Loading
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability due to unvalidated user input (`config.profile`) being appended to paths via `Path::join` without validation in `src/paths.rs`.
**Learning:** `Path::join` replaces the base directory when the appended string is an absolute path or traverses upwards with `..`, leading to severe security risks like exposing or overwriting arbitrary files.
**Prevention:** Validate user-provided strings used in file paths via `crate::utils::validate_file_name` to strictly enforce an allowlist (alphanumeric, underscores, dashes) before passing to `join`.
